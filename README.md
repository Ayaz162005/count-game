## About The Game

Catch The Duck is a fun and strategic web-based game based on the mathematical concept of Nim. The goal is simple: be the player who adds the last duck to reach the target number exactly. Outsmart your opponent by forcing them into positions where they cannot win!

This game serves as an interactive demonstration of game theory and basic AI, showing how a bot can use a simple mathematical formula to play optimally.

## How to Play

1. **Set the Rules:**

   * **Ducks to Catch (N):** The target number of ducks to win.

   * **Max Ducks per Turn (K):** The maximum number of ducks a player can add in a single turn (from 1 to K).

2. **Take Turns:** Players take turns adding 1, 2, or up to K ducks to the pond.

3. **Winning:** The player who adds the final duck to make the total exactly equal to N wins the game.

## Features

* **Player vs. Bot:** Challenge an AI with multiple difficulty levels, from "Very Easy" to "Impossible."

* **Player vs. Player:** Play against a friend in a local two-player mode.

* **Strategy AI Panel:** Get real-time insights into the game's state. The panel explains the winning strategy, tells you if your position is favorable, and shows the optimal move.

* **Bot's "Thoughts":** When playing against the bot, its thought process is displayed, revealing the logic behind its movesâ€”perfect for understanding AI decision-making.

* **Special Modes:**

  * **Classic:** The standard game of Nim.

  * **Crocodiles!:** A fun twist where hidden "crocodiles" are placed on the board. Landing on a crocodile results in an instant loss!

* **Customizable Themes:** Play in Day, Night, or Sunset mode.
